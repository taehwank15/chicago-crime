#An Analysis of Chicago Crime

### Goal
Often called _Chiraq_, Chicago is often known for its problems in crime. This project seeks to analyze recent patterns of crime in Chicago. Using visualizatoins and models, I hope to answer questions such as In which areas is crime most common? , When is crime most fervent? , and What types of crime are common?

### Overall Findings
Fortunately, there has been a steady and significant decrease in crime in Chicago, based on the number of cases of crime. Looking into Crime by Time in Chicago, it seems to be most dangerous during the first nights of summer months. Interestingly, much of the arrests and crime reports came from the Western and Southern sides of Chicago. This is consistent with commonly-held beliefs in Chicago that these sides are comparatively more dangerous than Northern areas.

### Data
The crime data for this project was downloaded form the Chicago Data Portal, available [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2). The shapefile for the Chicago map was always exported from this portal.

Furthermore, this data extracts the decade from 2008 to 2018 and samples 900,000 data points out of the over 3.2 million cases from this decade.

The population data has been taken from the CMAP (Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning) Data Hub and can be found [here](https://datahub.cmap.illinois.gov/dataset/community-data-snapshots-raw-data/resource/8c4e096e-c90c-4bef-9cf1-9028d094296e).
